# Google-Trends-Comparison
Tool to compare google search trends to identify popularity within brands,products or anything useful for marketting.


What You Can Do with This Tool:
Input Search Terms:

You can manually enter search terms (keywords) you're interested in tracking or load them from a text or CSV file.
These terms will be compared using Google Trends to see how popular they’ve been over the last year.
Compare Across Regions:

You can choose to compare search trends globally, or in specific regions (like the US, UK, etc.).
This allows you to see if certain terms are more popular in one region compared to another.
View Trends Over Time:

For each term, the tool will show you the interest over time, broken down into yearly, monthly, and weekly averages.
This is useful for identifying seasonal trends or tracking the rise or fall of a term's popularity.
Interactive Graphs:

The tool generates interactive graphs using Plotly that let you visualize the trends for each term.
You’ll be able to see how search interest fluctuated over the past 12 months.
World Map (Optional):

You can also generate a global map to visualize where a term is most popular worldwide. This is helpful if you want to see geographic interest.
Generate and Save Reports:

After comparing terms, you can save the results as an HTML file that opens in your browser. It includes charts, data tables, and summaries for easy viewing or sharing.
You can also merge multiple HTML files into one report, which is useful if you're comparing many terms across different sessions.
How You Use It:
Start the Application:

When you run the code, a simple window will open. You’ll see fields to enter search terms, dropdowns to select regions, and buttons to load terms from files or generate the analysis.
Enter Search Terms:

Type the terms you want to compare, or load them from a file (like a .txt or .csv). The tool supports multiple terms at once.
Choose Regions (Optional):

You can select two regions (like US, UK, etc.) if you want to compare trends across different places, or you can leave this blank for global trends.
Generate Graphs:

Once you’ve entered the terms and selected regions, click the “Plot Trends” button. The tool will then fetch the data from Google Trends and generate both line graphs and (optionally) maps.
Save and View the Report:

The tool will generate an HTML report showing your results. You can save this to your computer and view it in a browser.
Merge Reports (Optional and Non functionin yet):

If you have multiple trend analyses saved as HTML files, you can merge them into a single report for easier comparison.
